*I found* you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel **like Kanye,** I'm Bound 2
## Shawty, if you down I'm down to
## Yeah, I found you High class, shawty so bad
High class, shawty so bad
*Hella swag, she got all these girls* mad
## She the type of girl a nigga wish he had
She the type that if you get her, you can brag
*Little shawty got her own and I like that
Hit the mall,
*item 3a she ain't worried 'bout a price tag
*She can get whatever she* want She can get that new Saint Laurent
 *item3a I could put that Rollie on her arm
And I can get the bracelet with the charm
